            "question": "Here's a fun riddle that I think you'll enjoy.\n\nYou have been selected to play the final round of the hit new game show \"Pick That Ping-Pong\". In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.\n\nA device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.\n\nThe ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.\n\nWhich ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize? Please provide your answer as the number of the ball selected.",

                "Steps": "1. I start with the first line, \"T H E S E\" and proceed to the next, \"A G U L L\". At this point, I am able to discern that \"A G U L L\" is probably meant to be \"A GULL\". However, I continue to read through the rest of the lines to get a sense of any other words that might jump out that would substantiate \"A GULL\" being accurate both semantically and syntactically. 2. So now I am on the last line and decide to work backwards. \"CHAIR\" is on the last line all by itself and this does seem a plausible fit as a full word rather than a fragment of another word. When I look to the line directly above \"Y T O M Y\", the word \"my\" jumps out and this is a natural accompaniment to the noun often used to indicate possession. \n3. Eliminating the \"MY\" at the end of \"Y T O MY\" leaves \"Y T O\" remaining in the line and I immediately recognize the preposition \"TO\". It is a this point I am fairly confident that \"TO MY CHAIR\" is most likely accurate. Given that there is only a \"Y\" left, I discern it is more than likely the end of a word located in the row above.\n4. I am now on the fifth row down and am looking at the letters \"E F U L L\" Attaching the \"Y\" left over from the sixth row below I see \"E F U L L Y\"  I recognize the word \"FULLY\" I know it can stand alone as an adverb or it can serve as a suffix to a larger adverb.\n5. Detaching the \"FULLY\", leaves the \"E\" alone on the line. Knowing it does not represent a word on its own in the English language, I look to attach it to the line above (row 4).\n6. The fourth row reads \"D P E A C\". Adding the \"E\" to the end, the first word I can separate out is \"ACE\". However \"ACEFULLY\" is not a word nor does \"ACE FULLY TO MY CHAIR\" make sense. When working my way left through the line, continuing to attach each letter as I go, I land on the \"P\" and am fairly confident that the word is \"PEACEFULLY\".\n7. Eliminating the \"PEAC\" from the row leaves me left with a \"D\". Now I look at the row above, row 3 and see that the row comprises the word \"GLIDE\" Adding the \"D\" to the end of the word would not only be permissible in terms of a displaying appropriate tense but it also makes sense as I add it to the fragment I have so far. I now can read \"GLIDED PEACEFULLY TO MY CHAIR\".\n8. Now, I am on the second line and if I were to read it from there on down it would read \"A GULL GLIDED PEACEFULLY TO MY CHAIR\".  While this reads well and makes sense semantically and syntactically on its own, it does not make sense when I add the first row. THESE A GULL GLIDED PEACEFULLY TO MY CHAIR.  So now I am left with the conclusion that  \"A GULL\" is not correct. Either it is part of a larger word or the letters need to be broken down further. At a quick glace, I can see that they don't make sense being broken down further so I leave \"GULL\" and add the \"A\" to the string above. Immediately my eye sees that \"A can be added to \"SE\" to make \"SEA\" and that the remaining\nletters spell the word \"THE\"  I now know the sentence reads \"The seagull glided peacefully to my chair.",

As he reached to scoop them into his backpack, a mysterious voice filled the room. \"You have fallen for my trap adventurer,\" the voice began, and suddenly the doorway to the chamber was sealed by a heavy rolling disk of stone. The adventurer tried to move the stone disk but was unable to budge the heavy stone. Trapped, he was startled when the voice again spoke. \n\n\"If you solve my riddle, I will reward you with a portion of my riches, but if you are not clever, you will never leave this treasure chamber. Before you are 200 gold coins. I pose a challenge to you, adventurer. Within these stacks of coins, all but 30 are face-up. You must divide the coins into two piles, one is yours, and one is mine. You may place as many coins as you like in either pile. You may flip any coins over, but you may not balance any coins on their edges. For every face-down coin in your pile, you will be rewarded with two gold coins. But be warned, if both piles do not contain the same number of face-down coins, the door will remain sealed for all eternity!\"\n\nThe adventurer smiled, as this would be an easy task. All he had to do was flip over every coin so it was face down, and he would win the entire treasure! As he moved to the columns of coins, however, the light suddenly faded, and he was left in total darkness. The adventurer reached forward and picked up one of the coins, and was shocked when he realized that both sides felt almost the same. Without the light, he was unable to determine which side of the coin was heads and which side was tails. He carefully replaced the coin in its original orientation and tried to think of a way to solve the puzzle. Finally, out of desperation, the adventurer removed 30 coins to create his pile. He then carefully flipped over each coin in his pile, so its orientation was inverted from its original state.\n\n\"I've finished,\" he said, and the lights returned. Looking at the two piles, he noticed that the larger pile contained 14 face-down coins.\n\nWhat was the outcome for the adventurer? If he failed the challenge, please respond with \"The adventurer died.\" Otherwise, please provide the number of coins the adventurer won at the conclusion of the riddle. If the adventurer won any coins, provide your response as the number of coins, with no other text.",

Convert 71\u00b007\u203201\u2033W to decimal degrees using the formula [decimal degrees] = [degrees] + [minutes] / 60 + [seconds] / 3600 to get approximately 71.1169\u00b0W for Harvard's longitude, which is further west than the University of Massachusetts Boston's longitude.\n7.

It features the players of the most recently aired season. I click on the Seasons tab and scroll down to the first season. I find the winner from the first season (based on my list compiled from the en.wikipedia.org site mentioned in step 1) and scroll through the bio information until I see the mention of their birthday. It is usually contained in the last sentence of the bio. I repeat this process until I get to Season 18. It is at this point that CBS starts to omit the full birthdays. For seasons 18 and 19 they include the month and date but omit the year. By Season 20, the birthday is omitted completely. \n4. So now I am making a simple template entry in google for each successive winner: When was (insert winner's name), winner of (insert season they won) of Survivor born?  There are usually two prominent sites I look for in my Google feed for this information:\n\n             1. Wikipedia page for that contestant: ex.: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._T._Thomas_(Survivor_contestant)\n             2.

Each die in the bag had six sides, but the sides had different values. There were four players, Kevin, Jessica, James, and Sandy, and one referee, Bruce. The bag held the following ten dice, with the following values on each face.\n\nThe blue die: 2,4,6,8,10,12\nThe red die: 2,2,4,4,6,6\nThe green die: 5,5,5,5,5,5\nThe white die: 6,6,6,6,6,6\nThe black die: 0,0,0,0,0,0\nThe orange die: 2,4,2,4,2,4\nThe yellow die: 2,4,2,4,2,4\nThe rainbow die: 10,10,10,0,0,0\nThe clear die: 2,2,4,4,6,6\nThe brown die: 4,0,4,0,4,0\n\nThe rules of the game were simple. Each of the players would draw one die from the bag in sequence. After all of the players had drawn two dice from the bag, they would be given a sheet of paper and a pencil. The players would then each go and roll their pair of dice 10 times, and write down the total for each roll. They would then add up all 10 of the totals, and this was their final score.\n\nAfter all of the players were done rolling dice, they returned to the referee and submitted their final score. The referee then had to decide who the winner of the game was.\n\nThe winner of the game was the player who reported the highest score. However, if a player made a mistake adding up their score or if the player cheated and wrote down a score that they couldn't have earned by playing, the player was disqualified.\n\nKevin reported his score was 185\nJessica reported her score was 42\nJames reported his score was 17\nSandy reported her score was 77\n\nThe only information Bruce had as the referee was the scores reported by the players, and the knowledge that the two dice that hadn't been drawn were the black die and the rainbow die.\n\nWho did Bruce declare as the winner?",

The game pieces are red, orange, indigo, cyan, magenta, and gray. Players draw a random game piece out of a provided opaque sack in order to find out playing order. The player who draws the cyan piece goes first, followed by gray, then indigo, then magenta, then orange, then red.\n\nThe game pieces start on the purple START square. Players roll a 5-sided die to see how far they move each turn, following the turn order given above. Each square is one space. The number of spaces moved corresponds to the number on the die roll. To win, a player must land on the purple FINISH square, ending the game. Each yellow square that players land on requires the player to move that many spaces backwards and play the square they land on, unless it is another yellow square. Each pink square that the players land on adds the number of points on the square to their total score. Each blue square that the players land on requires the player to move their game piece that many spaces forward and not play the square they land on, unless it is another blue square. Each green square that the players land on reduces their total score by the number of points on the square.\n\nSix players join the game: Alphonse, Makena, Caleb, Philip, Jun, and Diana. Makena draws the red piece, Alphonse draws the orange piece, Jun draws the cyan piece, Diana draws the magenta piece, and Philip draws the gray piece, and Caleb draws the indigo piece. Their die rolls in order of the turns they take are as follows:\n\n1, 4, 3, 1, 3, 3, 5, 4, 5, 4, 3, 5, 1, 4, 1, 4, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 5, 4, 2, 3, 5, 4, 3, 4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 4, 5, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 5, 3, 2, 1, 1, 5, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 5, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 4, 5, 5, 3, 5, 1, 3, 4, 3, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 5, 2, 1, 4, 5, 4, 5, 2, 2\n\nAt the end of the game, they all add up their points. Makena is the winner. Since they added up their points, what number was on the last square Makena landed on before the FINISH square?",

The dice settle into a 4\u00d74 tray so that only the top letter of each cube is visible. After they have settled into the tray, a three-minute sand timer is started and all players simultaneously begin the main phase of play.[3]\n\nEach player searches for words that fit the following criteria:\n\nWords must be at least three letters in length.\nEach letter after the first must be a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal neighbor of the one before it.\nNo individual letter cube may be used more than once in a word.\nNo capitalized or hyphenated words are allowed.\nMultiple forms of the same word are allowed, such as singular/plural forms and other derivations. Each player records all the words they find by writing on a private sheet of paper. After three minutes have elapsed, all players must immediately stop writing and the game enters the scoring phase.\n\nIn this, each player reads off their list of discovered words. If two or more players wrote the same word, it is removed from all players' lists. Any player may challenge the validity of a word, in which case a previously nominated dictionary is used to verify or refute it. Once all duplicates and invalid words have been eliminated, points are awarded based on the length of each remaining word in a player's list. The winner is the player whose point total is highest, with any ties typically broken by a count of long words.\"\n\nStep 5: Using a web browser, navigate to the nominated dictionary specified by my user, https://github.com/dwyl/english-words\nStep 6: Navigate to the linked page, https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_alpha.txt\nStep 7: Download the words_alpha.txt dictionary and save it to my file system as \"words_alpha.txt\"\nStep 8: Using a Python IDE, create a new project to solve the user's request as specified\nStep 9: Compose a Python program that accepts an input string and prints an output of all words that can be generated that match words in the nominated dictionary.

Observe that the smaller astronaut in the image is the one reflected in the other's helmet, so the smaller astronaut must be Charles \"Pete\" Conrad.\n5. Go to the Wikipedia page for Charles \"Pete\" Conrad.\n6. Search for \"Astronaut Group\" to find that Conrad was a member of NASA Astronaut Group 2.\n7. Open the Wikipedia pages for each member of NASA Astronaut Group 2.\n8. For those who are not deceased, go to View history and select the latest version of their Wikipedia page as of August 2023.\n9. Compare the times listed in the infobox of each astronaut's Wikipedia page under \"Time in space\", observing that Ed White has the least time in space with 4d 01h 56m, but also that Elliott See does not have a listed \"Time in space\".\n10. Read through Elliot See's Wikipedia article to find that he died in an accident before his first space flight, so he should be excluded, making Ed White's 4d 01h 56m the least amount of time in space.\n11. Convert 4d 01h 56m to minutes: 4d * 24h/d * 60m/h + 1h * 60m/h + 56m = 5,876m\n12. Format the final answer as specified: White; 5,876",
