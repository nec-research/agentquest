# MasterMind

Mastermind is a code-breaking game where one player creates a secret code of a fixed lenght with digits from 0 to 9, and the other player tries to guess the code. The code-maker provides feedbackd after each guess, indicating the number of correct colors and their correct positions, allowing the code-breaker to deduce and refine their guesses.

## Deductive Reasoning
The reasoning type category for this benchmark is deductive reasoning. Players utilize deductive logic and inference to narrow down possibilities and systematically determine the secret code based on feedback received after each guess.

## Benchmark categories
We provide games with 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 digits codes. The categories are:
- `4 digits`
- `5 digits`
- `6 digits`
- `7 digits`
- `8 digits`
